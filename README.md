About vimium-firefox
--------------------
This is my own fork of the [Vimium Firefox](http://code.google.com/p/vimium-firefox/) extension, which seems to have been abandoned by
its original author.

Problems with the original version
----------------------------------
I love the way this extension is *supposed* to work, but:
* It is unmantained by original author;
* It clashes with many websites and doesn't provide a website blacklist;
* It fires in the browser's URL bar (awful). 

My changes
----------
At the moment the only new feature I've implemented in this fork is a generic website blacklist. To add, change or remove websites you need
to edit the source code and rebuild the extension.

Planned features
---------------
*If* I get some free time, I will:
* Add an interface for blacklisting websites;
* Fix the URL bar bug.
