About vimium-firefox
--------------------
This is my own fork of the [Vimium Firefox](http://code.google.com/p/vimium-firefox/) extension, which seems to have been abandoned by
its original author.

Problems with the original version
----------------------------------
I love the way this extension is *supposed* to work, but:
* It is unmantained by original author;
* It clashes with many websites and doesn't provide a website blacklist; (ugly workaround).
* ~~It fires in the browser's URL bar (awful).~~ (fixed!)

My changes
----------
* 2014-06-19: Fixed bug that makes Vimium activate accidentally when typing in the browser's URL bar.
* Quick and dirty generic website blacklist. There's no GUI, it requires changing an array in the source code and rebuilding the extension.

Planned features
---------------
*If* I get some free time, I will:
* Add an interface for blacklisting websites;
* ~~Fix the URL bar bug.~~ (fixed!)
